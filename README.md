# Diabetes-predicton-using-HistGradientBoosting-
This repository contains a machine learning model developed to predict the onset of diabetes in patients using the HistGradientBoosting algorithm. The model was trained on a dataset containing various health parameters of individuals and their diabetes status.

The HistGradientBoosting algorithm is a powerful technique that can handle large datasets with high-dimensional features and provides accurate predictions. By leveraging this algorithm, we have developed a diabetes prediction model that can help healthcare professionals identify patients who are at risk of developing diabetes and take preventive measures.

In this repository, you will find the necessary code, data, and documentation required to replicate our results and use the model for your own research or application.
